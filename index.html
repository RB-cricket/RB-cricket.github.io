			<h1>The <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span> Dress by American short story writer O.Henry (1862-1910).</h1>
		</header>
		
		<p>We are to consider the shade known as <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span>. It is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man. Emperors claim it for their especial dye. Good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue. We say of princes that they are born to the <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span>; and no doubt they are, for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snub-nosed countenance of a woodchopper's brat. All women love it--when it is the fashion.</p>
		<p>And now <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span> is being worn. You notice it on the streets. Of course other colors are quite stylish as well--in fact, I saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross, with a triple-lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk, and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frills--but you see lots of <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span> too. Oh, yes, you do; just take a walk down Twenty-third street any afternoon.</p>
		<p>Therefore Maida--the girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamon-colored hair in the Bee-Hive Store--said to Grace--the girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermint-pepsin flavor to her speech--"I'm going to have a <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span> dress--a tailor-made <span class="finalLab3" value='Color'>Purple</span> dress--for Thanksgiving."</p>
